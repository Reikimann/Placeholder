# Distros and flavors

So the first big thing that has to happen when choosing to have your mind freed is that you have to choose a linux distrobution.

Now the hard part of that is really the choice, when your mind has been locked in this world where everything is picked and made for you, you cant comperhend the choice. Now thats what we aim to make easier here.

Tho before we get started we have to talk about a few facts and missconseptions

The first thing is really what we call **distro hopping** its where you go one distrobution for ~ a week and then hopping over to a new one. As a beginner its not about trying as much as you can but getting real good at one and maybe moving on then when you know what youre doing.

## The distrobutions

We will be raing each distro from 1 to 10 in different critira
