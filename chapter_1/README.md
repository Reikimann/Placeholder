# Chapter 1 - Getting started

In chapter one we are going over how you would first get started using linux, for a complete beginner this is a must-read. If you do head into any issues on your newly discovered adventure do not hesitate to open an issue and ask a question. For more experienced users there might be some interesting notes dotted around but some of the info we will attempt to explain so that a beginner can understand it.
