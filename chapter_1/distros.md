# Distros and flavors

So the first big thing that has to happen when choosing to have your mind freed is that you have to choose a linux distribution.

Now the hard part of that is really the choice, when your mind has been locked in this world where everything is picked and made for you, you cant comprehend the choice. Now thats what we aim to make easier here.

Tho before we get started we have to talk about a few facts and misconceptions.

The first thing is really what we call **distro hopping** its where you go one distribution for ~ a week and then hopping over to a new one. As a beginner its not about trying as much as you can but getting real good at one and maybe moving on then when you know what you're doing.

## The distributions

We will be ranking each distro from 1 to 10 in different criteria.

- Stability
- Security / Privacy
- Customizability
- Speed / Productivity
- Ease of use
- Update cycle
- Package selection

Also its important to note that this is **our Subjective Views on each distro**.

And with that we also wont jude them upon looks since that can entirely be changed, its how well i can be changed that we feel is important.
